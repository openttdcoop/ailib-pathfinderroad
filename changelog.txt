- Change: Road Pathfinder now uses AyStar 6 instead of AyStar 4.

      => The AyStar callback functions, _Cost, _Estimate, _Neighbours and
	     _CheckDirection have all changed their argument order. The self
		 parameter have changed from last to first as a consequence of using
		 AyStar 6 instead of 4.
